made the basic cad for the box and set it 3d printing
decided that I'm going to make this configurable to work with any laptop
and just cut the plastic myself
  

## 10/26/2025 2:38 PM - got the computer part  

![PXL_20251026_182946184](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTc1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c3abb7e174c23c0efdc1d7112acf193daf0ebdf/PXL_20251026_182946184.jpg)
tore apart an old HP 17z-ca200 to get the electronics inside
it doesn't have a bios battery so it will just have to stay plugged in
i'll probably wire up a usb hub that i have so it can be more durable  

## 10/26/2025 9 PM - printing   

started printing the case for the new computer. 
Decided to use a pegs-based system to mount he board with the screws that it came with.
will need to do a lot of gluing.![PXL_20251027_005741812](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTg3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c0b1a0b323a78028bff99a057328d8a6d63e8891/PXL_20251027_005741812.jpg)
  

## 10/31/2025 - glued  

finished printing
tried hot glue but it dried too fast
used gorilla glue and it worked (the plastic was pla)
waited for it to dry (not included in time)
got the extremely sophisticated clamps off (a wad of tape)

## 11/2/2025 - cuting  

cut the frame so that it had the holes for ports.
I chose to make it a solid frame that the user had to cut in order to make it work with more laptops than mine.
Caded the pegs for the screws to hole the board to the frame, I also made them glue-able so that they would work with any board.

## 11/4/2025 8 PM - finished  

Got it glued together, and put the board in.
It is pretty bad, but it works.
the ssd is glued in, but that is because it lacks a longer cable and it wouldn't fit anywhere.
It boots I think

## 11/4/2025 9 PM - did the repo  

I made the README and organized the files. Added sections about Printing, Assembly, and the BOM. 
The BOM is really just a laptop and 3d filament. I've included both .step and .stl for printability. Also I included the link to the onshape.
