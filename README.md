Making a desktop from a laptop<br>

<br>

I had an old <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-laptop-17z-ca200-8yk85av-1">laptop</a>, but it no longer worked, so I decided to turn it into a desktop. This will let you turn any old motherboard from a laptop, into a desktop.
<br>The original laptop is no longer made but you can probably find one on ebay, however, I've made it so that you can just put any board into it.
<br>
<br>
The .step and .stl print files are in /CAD
you can find the onshape <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/119253da891d8e3245ef7dcf/w/4ce91ff017f0e0c2d6eeb039/e/43b8a0fbfd1931149223f89a?renderMode=0&uiState=690522346415adc3b92b0360">here</a> 
## Printing
I printed out of pla, 0.3 mm layer height, 5% gyroid infill on my prusa mk3s+ from prusa slicer. Smallest side down (because my printer can't do long distances)<br>

<br>
glue can hold the parts together, I used gorilla glue <br>
For the peg:<br>

I printed at 0.3 mm layer height at 100% infill. It probably works other ways too. You can print a whole bunch at once.
<br><br>
## Assembly 
once it prints you can glue the frame together and the pegs into place. Make sure to also cut holes for the ports.
The laptop motherboard can then just screw into the pegs.
## Special parts
The wifi chip can either go into a normal peg or you can also edit the .step peg. It is the same with the ssd. Most other stuff can get glued.
## Customize
It's open source, go crazy.
