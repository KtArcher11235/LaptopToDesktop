Making a desktop from a laptop
I had an old <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-laptop-17z-ca200-8yk85av-1">laptop</a>, it is no longer made but you can probably find one on ebay. I've made it so that you can just put any board into it.

# Printing
I printed out of pla, 0.3 mm layer height, 5% gyroid infill on my prusa mk3s+ from prusa slicer. Smallest side down (because my printer can't do long distances)<br>

glue can hold the pecies together I used gorilla glue <br>

I printed at 0.3 mm layer height at 100% infill. It probably works other ways too. You can print a whole bunch at once.
